I look forward to bringing my Creativity and Leadership background to a Company where I can utilize my past and present skills"</blockquote></p>
            <hr />
            <p class="lead">I completed Web Development Immersive at General Assembly in LA, where I learned multiple programs that include; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Express and Ruby on Rails. Prior to General Assembly, I learned most of my coding through part time online programs like CodeAcademy, Code School and with various Books. I immediately realized it was time to fulfill my passion for web developer which led me to the GA Program.
            <p class="lead">My professional background consists of 8+ years Management level positions, specializing in Operations, Project Management, Sales and Leading Productive Employees for companies like Nordstrom and MAC Cosmetics. Regardless of the varied roles/responsibilities, my job everyday was to make sure that my Teams were focused, aligned, and producing at high level. I learned that Management has more to do with being an excellent teammate than just simply telling people what to do and making sure they do it.
            <p class="lead">As a Business Leader, I drove to take my skill set to the next level and the best way I learned how to do that was by focusing on learning new skills daily. It's that mentality to stay humble and keep learning that powered my previous positions and will continue to drive me in my future roles as a Web Development.
            <p class="lead">In conclusion of my specialized skill set as a Web Developer and Business Leader, I'm ready to deliver the skills with my attention to detail, time management, project management, communication skills, leadership and openness to learn and help me to excel as a Web Developer.</p>
